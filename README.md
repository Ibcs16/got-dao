# GOT DAO - A DAO for Game of Throne lovers ⚔️

Built during @_buildspace cohort for **Build a DAO** project

## What I've learnt:
- ✅ people can mint to join DAO.
- ✅ deployed governance contract + treasury.
- ✅ built a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by governance contract.
